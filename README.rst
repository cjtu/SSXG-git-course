==============================
Welcome to the SSXG Git Course
==============================

The first class will be on Friday July 21 at 10 am!

----------------------
Before the First Class
----------------------
Budget about 1-1.5 hours for the first pre-class homework assignment where you will be installing Git and learning the basics.

1) Head over to the `Git website <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_ to download and install Git on your personal computer. Although you will not need it for the Codecademy course, we will use it in the first lab.

2) Head over to the `Codecademy website <http://www.codecademy.com>`_. Register for a free account or log in if you already have one. 

3) Find the `Learn Git <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git>`_ module on Codecademy and complete the first two sections entitled "Basic Git Workflow" and "How to Backtrack in Git". Do not worry about the "PRO quizzes".

4) That's it! If you are having a lot of fun on Codecademy, feel free to finish the other 2 Git modules. If you are having a lot of fun registering for things, you can set up a profile at `GitHub <https://github.com>`_. But since we won't talk about branching, remotes, or GitHub until the second class, you can also save these until next week so that they are fresh in your mind for class 2. 

Happy Git-ing!
